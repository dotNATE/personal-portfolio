# Personal Portfolio - Practice Project

## Intro

This is a small project aimed at building on my HTML, CSS and Javascript experience. It is part of the Full Stack Engineer Path from Code Academy. (https://www.codecademy.com/).

The brief outlines loose requirements to build a personal portfolio page. I intend to keep adding to and modifying this project as my skill level grows and I need to demonstrate that I'm able to produce more complex work.

## Primary Goals

1. Easy to read! Though it goes without saying I've seen some truly awful portfolio sites in my time as a technology recruiter. It's important that the information on the page is easy to digest.
2. Accessibility - I'm not knowledgeable in this area, and I'd like to ensure that differently abled users are able to experience all of the content that I'm generating for this project.
3. Published - either to GitHub pages or to a purchased domain - not entirely sure yet.

## Technologies

HTML5, CSS3, Javascript ES6
