# Personal Portfolio - Practice Project

## Intro

This is a small project aimed at building on my HTML, CSS and Javascript experience. It is part of the Full Stack Engineer Path from Code Academy. (https://www.codecademy.com/).

The brief outlines loose requirements to build a personal portfolio page. I intend to keep adding to and modifying this project as my skill level grows and I need to demonstrate that I'm able to produce more complex work.

After starting this project and pouring several hours into it I relaised that my designs were too ambitious! i was spending absurd amounts of time trying to achieve a style that I did not have the skill to recreate. The rate at which I was learning slowed and my motivation started to waver.

In response to this I simplified my design and am starting again, totally from scratch! I'm going to keep using the same repo on GitHub to show my progress down the rabbit hole, and back out again.

## Primary Goals

1. Easy to read! Though it goes without saying I've seen some truly awful portfolio sites in my time as a technology recruiter. It's important that the information on the page is easy to digest.
2. Accessibility - I'm not knowledgeable in this area, and I'd like to ensure that differently abled users are able to experience all of the content that I'm generating for this project.
3. Published - either to GitHub pages or to a purchased domain - not entirely sure yet.

## Technologies

HTML5, CSS3, Javascript ES6

## To-Do

1. Consider introducing CSS grid to aid in layout of page
2. use img tag instead of div w/ background-image in about-me section - this will increase accesibility [DONE]
3. Re-write CSS for "about-me" section [DONE]
4. Add Icons and links to project section (links to as yet built, separate projects archive)
5. Re-design contact links to increase accessibility - include words
